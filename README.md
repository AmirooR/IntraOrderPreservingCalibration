## Requirements

To create the environment, you should have python3 and virtualenv installed, run these commands inside the source code directory:

```setup
virtualenv -p python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate                                 
pip3 install torch torchvision tqdm easydict scikit-learn
```

## Setup

- Put the corresponding logits to the data folder. 
The configs are in the paths with following format: `exp_dir/{dataset}/{model}/{method}/config.json`

where dataset, model, and method should be replaced with the desired dataset, model, and method's name.
(e.g., `"exp_dir/CIFAR100/ResNet110/OI/config.json"`)

## Training

To train the calibrator network:

```train
python calibrate.py --exp_dir exp_dir/{dataset}/{model}/{method}
```

## Evaluation

To evaluate the trained networks:

```eval
python evaluate.py --exp_dir exp_dir/{dataset}/{model}/{method}
```

## Results

The results will be saved in json format in the config dirname. As an example: `"ensemble/post_metrics_test_ensemble_best_ece.json"` corresponds to the ece values reported in Table 1 of the paper and `"cross_val_test_post_metrics_best_ece.json"` corresponds to the results without ensemble (by averaging the metrics over different folds). Note that the ensemble is followed by Kull etal 2019.
